The calculations were based on the modified-strip-analysis method, the subsonic-kernel-function method, piston theory, and quasi-steady second-order theory. Results of t h e analysis and comparisons with experiment indicated that: (1) Flutter speeds were accurately predicted by the modified strip analysis, although accuracy at t h e highest Mach numbers required the use of nonlinear aerodynamic theory (which accounts for effects of wing thickness) for the calculation of the aerodynamic parameters. (2) An abrupt increase of flutter-speed coefficient with increasing Mach number, observed experimentally in the transonic range, was also indicated by the modified strip analysis. (3) In the low supersonic range for some densities, a discontinuous variation of flutter frequency with Mach number was indicated by the modified strip analysis. An abrupt change of frequency appeared experimentally in the transonic range. (4) Differences in flutter-speed-coefficient levels obtained from tests at low supersonic Mach numbers in two wind tunnels were also predicted by the modified strip analysis and were shown to be caused primarily by differences in mass ratio. (5) Flutter speeds calculated by the subsonic-kernel-function method were in good agreement with experiment and with the results of the modified strip analysis. (6) Flutter speed obtained from piston theory and from quasi-steady second-order theory were higher than experimental values by at least 38 percent.",
